//! Prometheus metrics for the priority scheduler.
//!
//! Split to match design §9: this module holds the **operational** counters
//! and the queue-wait histogram (recorded on the admission / queue paths).
//! The point-in-time **capacity / autoscaling** gauges (inflight, queue
//! depth, utilization, per-tenant, …) are computed by the sampler task so
//! the hot admission path only does cheap counter increments.
//!
//! All names carry the `smg_` prefix to match the rest of the gateway's
//! metrics. Class/outcome labels are `&'static str` (no per-request
//! allocation).
