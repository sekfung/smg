    Concurrency model: per-step admission (mlx-lm.server-style)
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    The earlier drain-and-batch model — wait for ``_active_uids`` to be
    empty before allowing inserts — was a workaround for a
    cross-thread mlx-state corruption that surfaced as

        ValueError: [rope] offset must be a scalar or vector with N
            elements but has shape (N-1).

    inside ``mx.fast.rope`` (PR #1414). The drain wait paid for that
    correctness with a TTFT regression at high concurrency-to-batch-size
    ratio: a request arriving mid-decode of a 4-way batch had to wait
    for all four to finish (~3 s for chat) before its prefill could
    start.

    The actual root cause turned out to be threading, not insert timing.
    ``mlx_lm.generate.generation_stream`` is allocated by
    ``mx.new_thread_local_stream(...)``; mlx's ``mx.stream(s)`` context
    is per-thread. When the BatchGenerator is constructed on thread A
    (the asyncio main thread, in the original design) and ``next()``
    runs on thread B (the gen thread), the stream object's per-thread
    binding doesn't follow it — mx kernel calls and ``mx.async_eval``
    continuations later raise "no Stream(gpu, 1) in current thread".
    That's the same threading bug that made concurrent insert-during-
    decode unsafe in our setup, but mlx-lm.server doesn't hit either
    failure because it runs all mlx state on a single dispatch thread.

    This servicer now mirrors mlx-lm.server's design:

      * The BatchGenerator is constructed inside ``_generation_loop``
        on the gen thread, so its thread-local stream binds to that
        thread for the lifetime of the process. All ``insert()``,
        ``next()``, and ``remove()`` calls run on that same thread.
      * Per-step admission. Each iteration of the loop drains
        ``_pending`` (regardless of whether the batch is empty), calls
        ``insert()``, then advances by exactly one ``next()`` step.
        Worst-case admission delay is one decode step (~50 ms),
        matching mlx-lm.server's main loop.

    Flow:

      * Incoming ``Generate`` calls build a :class:`_PendingRequest` and
        push it onto ``self._pending``, then await ``uid_future``.
      * The gen thread, every iteration, drains ``_pending`` and calls
        ``BatchGenerator.insert()`` (which only appends to the
        ``_unprocessed_sequences`` deque — fast, no batch shape
        mutation). Then ``BatchGenerator.next()`` pulls from that deque
        into the prefill batch and advances generation by one token.
      * Each request's ``uid_future`` is resolved as soon as its uid is
        known so ``Generate`` can register its uid for ``Abort`` and
        start consuming tokens from its per-uid queue.

    Thread-safety: mlx-lm.server's signal pattern
    ---------------------------------------------
    Every mlx-state mutation — ``insert``, ``next``, ``remove`` on
    ``BatchGenerator``, plus all mutations of ``_active_uids`` /
    ``_uid_queues`` / ``_request_uid_map`` — runs on the gen thread.
    Event-loop callers (``Generate``'s ``finally`` / ``CancelledError``
    handler, ``Abort``) communicate with the gen thread by appending
    request_ids to ``self._aborted_request_ids`` (a set guarded by
    ``_pending_lock``). The gen thread drains that set at the start
    of each iteration and does all the cleanup work itself.

    This mirrors ``mlx_lm/server.py`` (``ctx.stop()`` flips
    ``_should_stop``; the gen thread observes it on the next
    iteration). Their pattern works because everything runs on one
    thread; ours works because the asyncio→gen-thread channel is a
    single shared set, and the gen thread reads it at a known point
    in each iteration.

    Concrete consequences:

      * ``Abort`` is non-blocking. It just adds to a set and returns;
        cleanup happens within one decode-step (~50 ms) on the gen
        thread.
      * No ``_gen_lock``. There is no shared mutable state between
        the gen thread and event-loop callers other than the
        ``_pending_lock``-guarded fields.
      * The race the prior lock-based fix closed (``Abort`` arriving
        between gen's ``_pending_by_request_id.pop`` and
        ``_request_uid_map[rid] = uid``) goes away naturally:
        ``Abort`` records the rid, the gen thread observes it
        ≥1 iteration later, by which time the prior iteration's
        transition is fully committed and ``_request_uid_map[rid]``
        is reliably populated.

    ``self._pending_lock`` is the only lock. It guards
    ``_pending`` / ``_pending_by_request_id`` (request submission)
    and ``_aborted_request_ids`` (cleanup signal). Held only briefly
    each time, never nested with anything else.

    Cost model: ``Abort`` returns within microseconds (one
    set-add). Cleanup of an aborted request lags by at most one
    decode step (~10–50 ms on M-series).
